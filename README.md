Prop Hunt Redux
==================

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/powerlord/sourcemod-prophunt.svg?branch=master)

Prop Hunt Redux is an effort to fix various issues with Prop Hunt and also to add some new features to the game mode.

The major changes in Prop Hunt Redux over Prop Hunt 1.93 are:

1. Major work has been done to fix issues with the prop list, such as props that were stuck in the floor.
2. Hunter self-damage has been fixed for newer Flamethrowers... you won't instant-kill yourself with the Phlogistinator or Rainblower any more.
3. The weapon list has been adjusted and some new options enabled.
4. New maps and their configurations have been added to the [map list](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2048443#post2048443).
5. Prop Hunt has had a lot of work done to make it more multi-mod friendly.
